# Gravity is Like a Magnet!

## Simple Explanation
Gravity is a force that pulls everything down toward the Earth. It‚Äôs the reason why we don‚Äôt float and why dropped things fall to the ground.

## Helpful Comparison
Gravity is like a magnet that pulls everything down. Just like how a fridge magnet sticks to the door, gravity keeps us on Earth.

## Key Words to Know
- *Force*: A push or pull on something  
- *Gravity*: A natural force that pulls things down  
- *Mass*: How much "stuff" something has inside

## Picture This
Imagine the Earth with invisible strings pulling everything toward its center ‚Äî that's gravity in action!

## Try These Activities
1. Drop a ball and watch how it always falls down  
2. Try jumping up and feel how you're pulled back  
3. Draw the Earth and show arrows pointing down from all directions
üß∑ Constraints
Always maintain scientific/academic accuracy
Match language and examples to the student‚Äôs grade level and context
Use visuals or comparisons from everyday experiences (home, school, environment)
Keep activities low-resource, hands-on, and suitable for Indian school contexts
Limit the content In to 200 to 300 words
