# Sahayak: AI Teaching Assistant for Multi-Grade Classrooms

## 1. Brief about the idea

**Sahayak** ("assistant" in Hindi) is an AI-powered teaching assistant designed specifically for under-resourced schools in India where a single teacher often manages multiple grades simultaneously in one classroom. The platform leverages Google's Gemini and Vertex AI technologies to reduce teacher workload and improve educational outcomes by generating localized teaching materials, differentiated content, visual aids, and interactive activitiesâ€”all accessible in regional languages and designed to work in low-connectivity environments.

Sahayak addresses the critical challenge of teacher overload by automating time-consuming tasks like lesson planning and content creation, allowing teachers to focus on what matters most: meaningful interaction with students across different learning levels and grades.

## 2. Opportunities

### How different is it from existing solutions?
- **Hyper-localization**: Unlike generic EdTech platforms, Sahayak generates content in regional languages with culturally relevant examples and contexts specific to rural and semi-urban India.
- **Multi-grade focus**: Specifically designed for the unique challenge of teaching multiple grades simultaneously, unlike most EdTech solutions that assume grade-segregated classrooms.
- **Low-tech compatibility**: Works with minimal technology (can export to printable formats, create blackboard-friendly visuals) unlike solutions requiring 1:1 devices.
- **Multimodal input/output**: Accepts voice, text, or images as input and generates diverse output formats suitable for varied teaching contexts.

### How it solves the problem
- **Reduces preparation time**: Automates the creation of lesson plans, worksheets, and visual aids that would normally take hours.
- **Enables differentiation**: Instantly creates variations of the same material at different complexity levels for different grades.
- **Bridges resource gaps**: Provides access to high-quality teaching materials even in schools with limited resources.
- **Supports vernacular education**: Functions in local languages, enabling teachers to provide instruction in students' mother tongues.

### USP of the proposed solution
- **Designed for the multi-grade classroom reality** of rural India rather than imposing Western single-grade classroom models.
- **Works within existing constraints** (limited connectivity, minimal technology, vernacular medium) rather than requiring significant infrastructure upgrades.
- **Culturally contextual content generation** that reflects local communities, traditions, and references.
- **Adaptable to varying levels of teacher tech proficiency** with simple, intuitive interfaces.
